# Insurance Fraud Prediction Model
Final Project for Data Analytics Boot Camp

## Background 
ABC Insurance has requested you, as a data analyst, to build a model for identifying the risk of insurance fraud using their historical claims activity dataset. 
They aim to establish an insurance fraud management system.

Part 1: Extract from Excel

Insurance fraud can be committed by agents, customers, and vendors, either individually or in collusion.

Is it possible to create a model to detect customers with a high likelihood of insurance fraud?
Is it possible to create a model to detect employees with a high likelihood of insurance fraud?
Is it possible to create a model to detect vendors with a high likelihood of insurance fraud?
